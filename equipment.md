# Equipment used for testing

Before making this a research project, I talked to some people about the issue, but none of them could hear the problem. Until more people do, I can not rule out that my hearing is faulty (it isn't great, to be honest) or that I am mentally insane. It would be great to hear about others being able to verify this and the equipment used.

## Physical equipment in the initial discovery of the phenomena

Computer: Windows 10 PC - non-brand, I currently do not believe this matters.

Audio Interface: RÃ˜DE RodeCaster Pro, firmware v2.1.0, connected directly to PC (no USB hubs).

Speakers: JBL LSR305P MK II monitor speakers, connected through a JBL LSR310S subwoofer.

Headphone set 1: Sony MDR-7506

Headphone set 2: Sennheiser HD 26 PRO

As long as the volume output for the speakers is at "11 o'clock" or higher, the distortion is clearly audible. With the headphones it is also audible at slightly lower volumes.
